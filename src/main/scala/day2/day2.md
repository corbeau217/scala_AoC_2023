# day 2: scala
  scala attempt at day 2
## part 1
### strategy
1. ...thoughts:
  * this is dangerously close to monte carlo/las vegas algo
  * seems random chance build out O(n^2) for all possible then lookup
  * that's lazy, we should parser
  * syntax analysis ez with packrat parser
  * or we match case but that kinda weird
