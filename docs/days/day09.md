## part 1
### strategy
1. tbh recursive data structures honestly
2. length of each array is previousLength-1
3. keep going till the difference is all 0's then go back one
4. idea for implementation
    1. list for recursed diff array
    2. each list is 1 less length than the last
    3. just get the diff between each element pairing of the last one
    4. mark off if we found a non 0 at all 
    5. when we finished getting them all without getting a non 0, we go back through grabbing the last of each
5. we done'd it c:
