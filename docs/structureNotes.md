## general project file structure overview
* `${workspaceFolder}/.vscode/`
  - vscode files
  - *settings etc so we keep the workspace stuff*
* `${workspaceFolder}/data/`
  - input files
  - *this is where our scala files will look for their daily input files, so we can blacklist those files since AoC doesn't like having their datasets redistributed*
* `${workspaceFolder}/docs/`
  - documentation files
  - *for neatness and so we follow convention of where documentation is*
  - Subfolders:
    * `${workspaceFolder}/docs/days/`
      - day specific documentation files
      - *seperated out so we dont have one big long file, and means we can compartmentalise concepts easier. Unstarted days (where not even notes are added) have their file generated by a C program*
* `${workspaceFolder}/project/`
  - sbt/scala related files
  - *we include this so sbt/metals remembers that it's a scala project*
* `${workspaceFolder}/src/`
  - source files
  - *inside here is where our source files are, to follow convention of typical compilers i'm used to*
  - Subfolders:
    * `${workspaceFolder}/src/c/`
      - location for C source files
      - *simple scripts for file management mostly, but once we catch up we may attempt it in C later*
    * `${workspaceFolder}/src/main/scala/`
      - location for scala source files
      - *sbt wants us to use this specific folder and i forget how to change this. worrying about it too much meant i'd take away from the coding part so that's a later studiable*
      - Subfolders:
        * `${workspaceFolder}/src/main/scala/day*.scala`
          - each day's specific scala file
          - *using this format because then it's matching the markdown files meaning each is paired with its own scala file for compartmentalisation*
